### Known issues and workaround

Issue | Workaround
:--- | :---
Texture background is white instead of being transparent. | Open PBR Material Editor ("Extensions" > "Physically-Based Rendering" > "Edit Materials..."). Select material. Set "Alpha mode" to "Combined with background".
Texture is fully opaque whereas I set opacity to *n* %. | With your preferred photo editing software, set opacity **directly** to texture image. Use PNG as exchange format to preserve opacity. Reimport texture image in SketchUp.
Texture looks weird with perpendicular lines around. | With your preferred photo editing software, resize texture image to a [power of two](https://oeis.org/A000079/list) (e.g. *1024x2048*, *2048x2048*, *4096x4096*). Reimport texture image in SketchUp.
Orbit control doesn't obey. | Press <kbd>F11</kbd> to go fullscreen.
