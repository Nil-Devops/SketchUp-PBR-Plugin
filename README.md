Known issues and workaround
---------------------------

Issue | Workaround
:--- | :---
In PBR Viewport, loading never ends. | Reopen PBR Viewport, accept to "Propagate Materials to Whole Model".
In PBR Viewport, texture looks weird with perpendicular lines all around. | Resize texture image to a [power of two](https://oeis.org/A000079/list) (e.g. *512x512*, *1024x1024*, *2048x2048*, *4096x4096*). Reimport texture image in SketchUp. Reopen PBR Viewport.
In PBR Viewport, model disappears. | Press <kbd>F11</kbd> to go fullscreen. If you want to quit fullscreen, press <kbd>F11</kbd> again.
