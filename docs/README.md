Installation
------------

1. Be sure to have SketchUp 2017 or newer version installed.
2. Download required plugin: [glTF Export](https://extensions.sketchup.com/content/gltf-exporter).
3. Download latest PBR plugin in .RBZ format from [Releases](https://github.com/SamuelTS/SketchUp-PBR-Plugin/releases/).
4. Install both plugins following this [guide](https://help.sketchup.com/article/3000263).
5. Restart SketchUp.

Now, you should have a "Physically-Based Rendering" menu in SketchUp "Extensions" menu. üëç
From this new menu, you can: "Edit Materials", "Change Env. Map", "Force Viewport Update"  and "Export As 3D Object".

Additionally, you should have a new "PBR" materials collection in "Materials" tray. Enjoy! üòä
